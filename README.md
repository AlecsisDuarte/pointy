# Pointy

Pointy is a pointing poker facilitator app written in Flutter and using Firebase for data storage and google cloud functions for server-side processing.

This is a proof of concept / learning tool to experiment with Flutter architecture and user interface.

Currently the app is available on Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sweetcandy.pointy. If I decide to pay Apple the hundred bucks for a dev program membership, I'll post it to the App Store as well.

Pull requests are welcome, especially for Hacktoberfest! Feel free to add issues as well, this is my first Open Source project.
